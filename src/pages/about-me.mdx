<Prose>

I love exploring the tech world and its endless possibilities. 
As an avid reader, I enjoy losing myself in books of all kinds, 
   from fascinating stories to thought-provoking essays.

   I have fun learning **seemingly useless skills.**
   I believe each of these skills brings something unique and helps me 
   see the world in a different way. **Self-improvement is my central philosophy;**

   In my professional life, I specialize in **back-end development.**
   I love building systems that work well and are efficient,
   and I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code.
   Sometimes (often), I create unnecessary projects just to 
   upload them to GitHub, and I also tend to document the process
   of these projects on this blog.

   I enjoy **sharing knowledge** with others, whether it's through conversations 
   or building something together, no matter the scale of what we're making.
   I love helping new developers and **learning from my colleagues.**
   Additionally, I'm a **constant learner**, always looking for new things 
   to learn and challenges to tackle.
